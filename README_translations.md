# Translation Information

Currently, the platform is only available in English. However, this is to be changed!

A langauge switcher already exists and makes use of a [./data-local/dictionary.csv](data-local/dictionary.csv) file to load supported languages and their translated texts.

## Edit Translations

If you want to provide help with `French` or `Spanish` translations, please download the file `./data-local/dictionary.csv` and edit it with a spreadsheet editor such as Word, LibreOffice Calc or Numbers.

> [!TIP]
> You will be asked which separation character is used. Please select the `;`

## Testig translations

Save your changes to the file and simply start the platform. You might want to clear your cache to avoid cached results.

## Submitting your translations

Either 

* contact me on discord 
* create a pull request
* create an "issue" and attach the CSV there.

I appreaciate your help!
